Web3backers
---

Monetize your expertise.

Web3backers connects your existing social accounts and reputation (see lens, linkedin, twitter, etc.) to create a funding page for you to produce and sell content and your time. 

Each page gets its own unique smart contract which tracks user interactions and payments.

Monitor your engagement on-chain using events. Issue community tokens unique to your brand.

A web3 platform for creating content funding similar to onlyfans and patreon but without the middleman.

Example:
Upload
* Chris Buonocore - links to social (lens, twitter).
* Chris is creating web3 tutorials.
* Unlockable content, reveals a cid.
* Get in contact with Chris (XMTP)
* Connect account (Privy)
* Deploy contract per page (Neon, Metamask, Scroll, XDC)
* UMA (user search)?
* Unlock (gated content and connection to XMTP)
* NFT API (quicknode)
* Mask (relationservice search) https://docs.next.id/core-concepts/relation-service/rs-example
